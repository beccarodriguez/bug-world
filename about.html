    <h1> *Becca Rodriguez*</h1>
       
       <p>
       <p> Becca Rodriguez is a Florida-raised artist living in Atlanta, Ga. Their creative practice reflects on and is informed by the intersection of speculative fiction and prefiguration: how learning and dreaming about worlds within and beyond our own can affix us in them presently. Fluvial eggs, vessels, and ephemeral ecosystems are persistent motifs in their work across many disciplines: ceramic, sound, video, drawing, printmaking, papermaking, and bioplastic research.</p>

       <p>Becca received their BFA from the University of North Florida in 2017. They are a collective member of Side Clay Studio in Atlanta, Ga. They have taught a variety of media ranging in clay, printmaking, papermaking, and natural dyeing over the years in different areas of Atlanta and North Florida. </p>
       
           <p>Recently, Becca was a research volunteer at the Amphibian Foundation in Atlanta, Ga, assisting in conservation practices, specifically from egg to fully metamorphosed frog or salamander in the foundation's nursery. Their ceramic table-top game, "Metamorph", has been installed on the Emma Wetlands of the Blue Heron Nature Preserve near Amphibian Foundation's Metamorphosis Meadow and at the Museum of Contemporary Art Georgia.</p>

          <p> Statement</p>
             <p> I am fascinated by what we share in more subterranean environments, and what our landscape surfaces in this process. Waste, excess, remnants, growth, and decay are types of co-evolving ancestors to me. Loose leaf tea with a friend is saved to make paper, cabbage scraps are soaked and shifted to make dye. I look at chemical and physical property change as a perpetual type of re-creation myth. Infusing one physical thing with another is a type of birthing, and naming this infusion speaks to phylogeny and descent. Ephemerality and re-use are important functions within an object's lifecycle I enjoy interacting with.</p>
              <p>Biology, ecology, and evolutionary morphology have become central guides in my practice. I have recently started going on Fictional Species ID walks in so-called Atlanta, encouraging walkers to intimately explore the landscape while creating and logging fictional and existing species they may encounter within a provided Field Guide booklet. I plan to archive walkers' findings as a fictional species index of the southeastern U.S., which considers themes of extinction, conservation, construction, institution-led biospheric devastation, trash, flooding, emotional resilience, bravery, sadness, rage, joy, anything that bubbles up in this life. To access the first Field Guide, see the <a href="ecosystems.html">Ecosystems</a> page.</p>
